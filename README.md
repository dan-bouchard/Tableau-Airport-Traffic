# Tableau-Airport-Traffic
> Data visualisation using Tableau of Covid Airport Traffic data over the year 2020.

Using the dataset `covid_impact_on_airport_traffic.csv`, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terenceshin/covid19s-impact-on-airport-traffic). The data looks at airport activity across numerous airports throughout 2020 within: US, Canada, Auatralia and Chile.

I created a Tableau dashboard, the static version below and an interactive version can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dan.bouchard/viz/CovidAirportTraffic2020/CovidAirportTraffic2020).
